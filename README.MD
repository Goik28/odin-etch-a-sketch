This is supposed to be an etch-a-sketch. I'm supposed to create a lot of divs and paint them while the mouse is hovering the squares.
In the description of the exercise it's said to make those lot of divs appear as a grid.
Let us see what I prototype.

--------------------------

I think this project is finished. Did the painting logic for the drag mouse event, done the random color function and did a default color for when the page is loaded.
